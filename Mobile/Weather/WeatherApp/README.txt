WU DEVELOPER KEY TERMS OF USE
-----------------------------

Weather Underground, hereafter "WU", (http://api.wunderground.com/api/) provides weather data via its web API. A developer key is required as a parameter to API calls. By default, Bridge.NET, Inc., hereafter "The company", provides you with a hardcoded WU developer key. The company authorizes you to use this key solely for the purposes of building and running this Demo project as is. 

*Any other use is strictly prohibited*.

If you want to use the Bridge Weather Demo App in any other context or for any other purpose, you need to obtain your own WU developer key. You can sign up for a WU developer key at the following address, for free: http://api.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/login.html?MR=1
